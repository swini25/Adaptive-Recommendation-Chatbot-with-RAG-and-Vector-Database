# skin care Guide Chatbot with RAG and Vector Database

## Overview
This project is a domain-specific chatbot application that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLM) for understanding and processing natural language queries with the efficiency of a vector database for data storage and retrieval. The chatbot generates personalized skin care recommendations using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based solely on user inputs. The application is developed using Flowise and integrates various components to provide accurate and relevant healthcare advice to the users.

## Features
- *Domain*: skin care guide, providing personalized health recommendations and advice.
- *RAG-Based Recommendations*: Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide personalized healthcare recommendations.
- *Components Used*:
  - *Recursive Character Text Splitter*: For splitting the text into manageable chunks.
  - *CSV File*: For uploading and managing the healthcare data.
  - *OpenAI Embeddings*: For embedding queries and context using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model.
  - *Pinecone Upsert Document*: For storing and indexing data in Pinecone vector database.
  - *Conversational Retrieval QA Chain*: For retrieving relevant information.
  - *ChatOpenAI*: The main chat interface for interaction.
